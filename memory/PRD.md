## 🆕 v2.7 4H TIMEFRAME CALIBRATION ✅ (2025-12-16)

**CALIBRATED SIGNAL ENGINE FOR REALISTIC 4H TRADING:**

### Why Added:
- BTC on 4H timeframe moves in smaller ranges compared to daily charts
- Previous targets (2-4%) were unrealistic for 4H signals
- Need better move/R:R filtering to improve signal quality

### 4H Move Ranges Defined:
| Move Type | Range | Action |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Very Small | < 0.4% | NO TRADE / Confirmation mode |
| Normal Tradable | 0.5% – 1.2% | Standard signal |
| Strong 4H | 1.2% – 2.5% | Extended targets allowed |
| Exceptional | > 2.5% | Rare, cap expectations |

### 4H Target Calibration:
| Target | Normal Conditions | Strong Conditions |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **T1** | 0.5% – 0.9% | 1.2% |
| **T2** | 1.0% – 1.8% | 2.5% |

**Strong conditions** = High market energy OR Strong liquidity magnet OR Trend continuation setup

### 4H Risk/Reward Requirements:
| R:R Level | Value | Action |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Minimum | < 1.0 | NO TRADE (rejected) |
| Acceptable | 1.0 – 1.2 | Warning added |
| Good | 1.2 – 1.5 | No warning |
| Ideal | >= 1.5 | Optimal |

### Implementation Details:
- `MINIMUM_MOVE_PERCENT = 0.40` (was 0.50)
- `MIN_RISK_REWARD = 1.0` (new filter)
- `is_strong_market_condition()` helper function added
- Targets capped to nearest S/R levels when closer
- Move quality classification: weak/normal/strong/exceptional

### What Changed:
- ✅ Expected move now realistic for 4H (0.5-1.2% typical)
- ✅ Targets T1/T2 calibrated for 4H ranges
- ✅ R:R minimum filter prevents bad risk setups
- ✅ Strong conditions allow extended targets
- ❌ Core signal logic UNCHANGED (sweep/continuation detection)

---

## 🆕 v2.6 SIGNAL ENGINE VERSION TRACKING ✅ (2025-12-15)

**COMPARE V1 (SWEEP ONLY) VS V2 (SWEEP + CONTINUATION) PERFORMANCE:**

### Why Added:
- User wants to scientifically validate whether the new Trend Continuation logic improves overall signal quality
- Need to compare v1 (legacy sweep_reversal only) vs v2 (sweep + trend_continuation)

### Implementation:

#### 1. New Database Field:
| Field | Type | Values |
|-------|------|--------|
| `signal_engine_version` | string | "v1" or "v2" |

#### 2. Migration Endpoint:
| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/signal-history/migrate-to-v1` | POST | Tag all existing signals without version as v1 |

**Migration Result:** 103 historical signals tagged as v1

#### 3. Enhanced Signal History:
- New filter dropdown: **Engine Version** (All / V1 / V2)
- **V1 Badge** (gray) and **V2 Badge** (purple) displayed on each signal

#### 4. Enhanced Reliability Analytics:
**New Tab: "v1 vs v2"** with:
- Side-by-side V1 and V2 cards showing:
  - Total signals
  - Win Rate
  - Avg PnL
  - Profit Factor
  - WIN/PARTIAL/LOSS/EXPIRED breakdown
- **Performance per Version + Setup** table
- **Performance per Version + Direction** table
- Data collection status message

#### 5. New API Response Fields:
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `by_engine_version` | Stats grouped by v1/v2 |
| `by_version_setup` | Stats grouped by version + setup_type |
| `by_version_direction` | Stats grouped by version + direction |

### Current Data (2025-12-15):
| Version | Signals | Win Rate | Avg PnL | Profit Factor |
|---------|---------|----------|---------|---------------|
| V1 | 31 | 16.1% | -0.23% | 0.32 |
| V2 | 0 | - | - | - |

**Note:** All new signals generated will be tracked as v2. As data accumulates, performance comparison will become statistically significant.

### Signal Engine Logic:
- **V1 (Frozen):** Only `sweep_reversal` detection
- **V2 (Active):** `sweep_reversal` + `trend_continuation` detection, with intelligent setup selection

---

## 🔒 LOGIC FREEZE (2025-12-14)

**Trading logic is FROZEN until 150-200 signals are collected during weekday trading (Mon-Fri).**

### Frozen Components:
- ❄️ Signal generation logic
- ❄️ Market bias scoring
- ❄️ Whale activity detection
- ❄️ Liquidity magnet calculations
- ❄️ Target/stop calculations
- ❄️ Confidence scoring

### Why Frozen:
- Current data (95 signals) collected mostly during weekend
- Weekend = low volatility, more EXPIRED setups
- Need weekday data to accurately assess system performance

### Current Stats (to be re-evaluated at 150-200 signals):
- Total signals: 95 (60 with targets)
- LONG: 5 (80% win rate) ✅
- SHORT: 55 (1.8% win rate) ⚠️
- EXPIRED: 68% of outcomes

### Resume Conditions:
- [ ] Collect 150-200 signals
- [ ] Primarily weekday data (Mon-Fri)
- [ ] Re-run root cause analysis
- [ ] Determine if SHORT bias is systemic or market-driven

---

## v2.5 OHLC-BASED OUTCOME ENGINE ✅ (CRITICAL FIX)

**ACCURATE TRADE OUTCOME DETECTION USING HISTORICAL CANDLE DATA:**

### Problem Fixed:
The previous outcome engine only checked the **current price** to determine if targets/stops were hit. This caused:
- All 31 signals to show as EXPIRED (0 WIN, 0 LOSS)
- Missed cases where price touched target/stop and then moved away

### New Implementation:
Uses `analyze_ohlc_for_outcome()` function that:
1. Fetches 1-hour OHLC candles from Kraken
2. Filters candles within the signal's validity window
3. Checks **candle HIGH** and **candle LOW** against targets/stops
4. For LONG: HIGH >= target (win), LOW <= stop (loss)
5. For SHORT: LOW <= target (win), HIGH >= stop (loss)

### Results After Fix:
| Outcome | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| WIN | 0 | 2 |
| LOSS | 0 | 5 |
| PARTIAL_WIN | 0 | 3 |
| EXPIRED | 31 | 21 |

### New API Endpoint:
| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/signal-history/recalculate-with-ohlc` | POST | Re-analyze EXPIRED signals using OHLC |

### Technical Details:
- Analysis method now returns `"analysis_method": "OHLC_CANDLE_DATA"`
- Outcome notes include timestamp of when target/stop was hit
- `candles_analyzed` field shows how many candles were checked
- Both manual and scheduler checks use the new OHLC logic

- Low Market Energy (<50): +10 min
- Balanced Liquidity Magnet: +10 min
- continuation setup: +15 min
- Neutral whale activity: +5 min
- Low confidence (<55%): +15 min

### Urgency Determination:
- **HIGH** (score ≥8): Act immediately, signal may trigger soon
- **MEDIUM** (score 4-7): Valid setup, reasonable window
- **LOW** (score <4): Early setup, time available

### Frontend Display:
New "URGENZA SEGNALE" section in TradeSignalCard:
- Urgency badge (HIGH=orange/pulse, MEDIUM=yellow, LOW=gray)

## v2.0.1 LOGIC IMPROVEMENTS ✅

### 1. **Liquidity Magnet Score Scale:**
- BALANCED now shows neutral score (40-60) instead of 0
- `magnet_strength` for BALANCED is always "MODERATE"
- Score interpretation:
  - 0-30: WEAK (low directional attraction)
  - 40-60: MODERATE (balanced or neutral)
  - 65-80: STRONG (clear directional pull)
  - 81-100: VERY_STRONG (high directional pull)

### 2. **Conflict Handling:**
When Market Energy is HIGH + Liquidity Magnet is BALANCED + Whale Activity is NEUTRAL:
- Active signals downgraded to SETUP_IN_CONFIRMATION
- Confidence reduced by 15 points
- Warning displayed about unclear direction
